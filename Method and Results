Methods:
My project includes the set up, data acquisition, data extraction, cleaning and analysis of data from devices - FitBit and Bitalino ECG device. I am using R package fitbitscraper to extract data from the fitbit cloud and the rhd5 package to read the data from Bitalino device. For the Bitalino, I am using the Opensignals software and a Python Bitalino API to take measurements using the device . The data is related to heart rate measured in beats per minute and milliVolts for FitBit and Bitalino respectively. The main problem I am currently addressing is the convertion of the mV data from Bitalino to beats per minute. I am visualizing the plots of the heart rate acquired from both the devices. The main method used to analyze the data points acquired from both the devices is to plot Bland-Altman plots and a correlation to check for accuracy and conclude if FitBit can be used as a patient monitoring device.

Results:
My results will include screenshots of the softwares used, the devices used, plots of heart rate data measured, Bland-Altman plots and a correlation data result. I will explain the results of my hypothesis and also include information on further analysis and scope of this project at a larger scale.
