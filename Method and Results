Methods:
My project includes the devices - FitBit and Bitalino ECG device. I am using R package fitbitscraper to extract data from the fitbit cloud. For the Bitalino, I am using the Opensignals software and a Python Bitalino API to measure and extract data from the device. The data is related to heart rate measured in beats per minute and milliVolts for FitBit and Bitalino respectively. The main problem I am currently addressing is the convertion of the mV data from Bitalino to beats per minute. I am visualizing the plot of the heart rate acquired from both the devices. The main method used to
