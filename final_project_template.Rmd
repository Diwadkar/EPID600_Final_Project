Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation in class will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name and text below with your own, but leave the headers.

### Overview
The main focus of this project is to investigate the use of commercial wearables as possible patient monitoring devices by testing the precision of heart rate measurement by a wrist worn heart rate monitor (FitBit) against a portable ECG-based heart rate computer (Bitalino). The project will involve a statistical model to test the accuracy of the FitBit band.


### Introduction 
Wearable devices are being studied and explored for use as diagnostic monitors replacing the current complicated and expensive medical devices. Heart rate variation can be used for stress response detection due to behavioural, bacterial or other abnormalities. Now-a-days, wrist monitors like FitBit, Apple and Samsung are popular in the market. These devices use photoplethysmography which detects blood racing through the veins by optical sensors. Majority of the limited literature review proves that the bands are mostly accurate in heart rate measurement with few abnormalities at high bpm. 
    The problem addressed in this project covers the field of diagnostics, biomedical devices and data analysis. The project layout consists of device set up and measurement of heart rate at different physiological conditions. The main barrier is the extraction of data from the two devices. The data extracted has to be filtered and converted so that both variables are in same units. The statistical model will involve Wilcoxon signed-rank test or one sample t-test depending upon the distribution. The measurements will be quantified by Bland-Altman plots and correlation coefficients will be calculated. I met Mr. Jeff Pennington from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who is guiding me in this project and providing the devices for use. CHOP is interested in exploring the use of wearable devices and this project may aid them in determining the accuracy of these devices. 


### Methods
In the first paragraph, describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
