# EPID600 Final Project

This repository is dedicated to my project on wrist worn heart rate monitors and their use as probably patient monitoring devices. I am extracting the data from two devices - FitBit Surge band and Bitalino ECG device as a positive control.
My project involves heart rate measurement, data extraction, signal processing and statistical analysis. The repository consists of the RMD file with the code, data files from both devices, pictures of the devices, and ECG data images.
